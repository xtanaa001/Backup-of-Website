== 1. Battery Charging and Swapping Station Network: Models and Algorithms.

In this topic, we will investigate the models and scheduling algorithms for battery charging and swapping station (BSCS) network. The target is to propose realistic models and efficient algorithms to schedule the charging and swapping processes of a BSCS network with multiple battery charging stations and battery swapping stations. The ongoing work is mainly based on our following previous work:

== 2. Electric Vechile Charging with Flexibilities and Uncertainties: Optimality and Robustness.

In this topic, we will propose novel models and algorithms to analyze the value of flexibilities associated with the charging processes of electric vehicles. We will also investigate the impact of uncertainties on the charging processes of electric vehicles. Some of the ongoing papers are based on our following previous papers:
